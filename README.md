HTML5 design with a customize CMS

The HTML5 CMS is a customize CMS for this HTML5 design. 
I implement the backend for this HTML5 design where the user can update the info and images on the website without any assistant. 

For the Frontend design template, I used this design called Dimension. 
You can view and download the design template <a href="https://html5up.net/dimension" target="_blank">here</a>

For the Backend design template, I used CoreUI for the admin section. 
You can view and also download the admin design template <a href="http://coreui.io/examples" target="_blank">here</a>

For the Text Editor, I used TinyMce. 
You can view and also download the Text Editor <a href="https://www.tinymce.com/" target="_blank">here</a>

I created/design the html5-cms.pdf instruction file and also attached the design Icon PSD for icon and also CMS logo PSD for the logo for the admin section

You can read the html5-cms.pdf instruction before you can start to get familiar with the platform.

These are the languages and software I used for the HTML5-CMS:

Language: HTML5, CSS & PHP/PDO

Software: Atom, Photoshop and Indesign
